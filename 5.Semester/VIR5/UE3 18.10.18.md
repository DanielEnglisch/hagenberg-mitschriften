## Unit 3

In the previous unit we have manually setup a simple image with the `curl` tool installed. Letâ€™s move that forward such that we can do an automated build of that image.

1. Create a `Dockerfile` that creates an image based on alpine and installs the curl tool.

2. Build an image with the image (repository) name `alpine-with-curl`.

3. Run a Dockerfile lint tool to check if Dockerfile best practices are met. Use https://hub.docker.com/r/lukasmartinelli/hadolint/

4. Run a command in an instance (container) of the image we just built to check that the `curl` tool really is available to the container.
