## Unit 5

During the previous unit we have implemented a Docker image for a web application. In this unit we reimplement that application using `docker-compose`.

First we create a project directory with a sub directory app where the web application’s Docker related source will reside. We put the `Dockerfile` and all other required files from the previous unit into that directory.

Next we create a `docker-compose.yml` service configuration file in the project directory.

We add a definition for a service named `app` to this service configuration. This service should build an image from the context in the subdirectory `./app`. The service must publish the internal container port to the host’s port `80`.
- **Note**  
	We can validate the docker-compose configuration using the command `docker-compose config`.

```docker
version: '2.2'

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: ./app
    ports:
      - "80:8080"
```

Check config and validate:
```docker
docker-compose config
```

Check Composed containers in directory
```docker
docker-compose ps
```

Output von containern
```docker
docker-compose logs
```

Now we will be able to run the web application using the command `docker-compose up -d` and access the app’s UI at http://localhost/api.

With `docker-compose logs -f` we can follow the service’s console output.

Docker Compose up can be called multiple times, but the container will only be recreated if the image or the dockerfile changed.
