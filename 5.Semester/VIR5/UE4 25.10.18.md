## Unit 4

### Task 1: Starting a web application

In this assignment we build a Docker image that starts up a Spring Boot based web application. The web application is a Spring Boot Fat JAR with an embedded Tomcat Servlet Container running on port 8080. The JAR file must be started from the directory `/opt/app`.
- **Note**  
	The JAR file is downloadable from https://dl.bintray.com/software-craftsmen/continuousdelivery/at/software-craftsmen/continuousdelivery/latest/continuousdelivery-latest-exec.jar.

### Task 2: Healthcheck

Add a healthcheck based on the command `curl -f http://localhost:8080/api`. Run a container based on this image and watch the health status of the container.
- **Note**  
	You will find the documentation to health checking at https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck.

#### Task 3: Port binding

Make the web application accessible on the Docker host’s port 80 so we can open the app’s web UI through http://localhost/api.

#### Task 4: lint

Run a Dockerfile lint tool to check if Dockerfile best practices are met. Use https://hub.docker.com/r/lukasmartinelli/hadolint/
